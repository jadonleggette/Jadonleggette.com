            I am a Finance & Insurance Manager and business student who works at the intersection of
            finance, urban policy, and design. During the day I work in auto finance. Outside of work
            I build models, research economic inequality, and study how cities either expand or choke off opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I founded the RCC Finance & Investment Banking Society to give community college students
            a real path into high finance. We learn valuation and modeling, host speakers from industry,
            and treat Riverside as a living lab for questions about capital, growth, and equity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site connects three parts of my life: research on the wealth divide, documentary
            photography of Riverside and abroad, and leadership projects that try to move opportunity
            closer to the people who are usually shut out.

        <h3>The Price of the Dream: Confronting America’s Wealth Divide</h3>
        <p class="research-meta">
          Original research project, Riverside City College Student Research Conference
        </p>

        <p class="research-abstract-label">Abstract</p>
        <p class="research-abstract">
          This project examines how the American wealth divide is produced and sustained through
          the everyday structures of policy and place. Using Riverside and the Inland Empire as a
          case study, I connect tax policy, housing markets, and labor conditions to the spatial
          realities that people actually live in, such as long commutes, fragmented transit, and
          concentrated poverty. Drawing on economic data, urban planning research, and on-the-ground
          observation, I argue that inequality is not an accident or a temporary glitch in the market,
          but the result of deliberate choices about what and whom our cities are designed to serve.
        </p>
        <p class="research-abstract">
          The paper proposes reforms that treat equity as a design problem as much as a moral one:
          more progressive tax structures, aggressive investment in affordable and mixed income housing,
          and land use decisions that shorten distances between home, work, and essential services.
          By pairing quantitative analysis with the physical and emotional experience of moving through
          a city like Riverside, the project argues that closing the wealth divide requires changing both
          how capital flows and how space is built.

          <p>
            I want to use finance and urban planning to design fairer cities. That means treating a capital
            stack and a zoning map as two sides of the same question. Who gets to live near jobs. Who spends
            hours in traffic. Who benefits when a neighborhood is labeled up and coming, and who is quietly
            priced out.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, this looks like pushing into investment banking and urban research at the same time.
            I want to understand how deals get done, how money moves, and how those decisions land on specific
            blocks and buildings. Long term, I see myself working on projects where community outcomes are
            measured with the same seriousness as returns.

        <div>

            This site is a living record of that path. As my research deepens, as the RCC Finance & Investment
            Banking Society grows, and as I keep shooting new cities, I will keep updating this space.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are reading this as an admissions officer, a recruiter, or a future collaborator, this is
            the core of what I am building toward: cities where opportunity is not an accident, but something
            we design on purpose.
